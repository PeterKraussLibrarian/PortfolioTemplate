							<p> <strong>Becoming a Librarian</strong></p>
							<p>My journey from student to emerging professional has been shaped by a deep commitment to knowledge, service, and the transformative power of information. As I have progressed through my Master of Library and Information Science (MLIS) program at the University of South Florida, I have continued to refine my skills, expand my understanding of the field, and develop a clear vision of my role as an information professional.</p>
							<p>My academic background in Interdisciplinary Social Sciences, with a focus on economics, criminology, and psychology, has provided me with a strong foundation for understanding human behavior, systemic structures, and the ways information can empower both individuals and communities. These perspectives have proven invaluable in my work as a Library Technician at St. Pete West Community Library, where I’ve gained firsthand experience in public service, information literacy, and community engagement.</p>
							<p>Throughout my studies, I have grown from a curious learner into a thoughtful practitioner. I have developed a greater appreciation for the ethical responsibilities of information professionals, particularly in ensuring equitable access, fostering lifelong learning, and adapting to the evolving needs of communities. My coursework and professional experiences have strengthened my technical competencies, research skills, and ability to navigate digital resources, all of which are essential for modern librarianship.</p>
							<p>Beyond technical skills, I have come to recognize the importance of connection, compassion, and advocacy in this field. Libraries are not just repositories of books, they are community hubs, safe spaces, and gateways to opportunity. As I move forward in my career, I am committed to upholding these values, continuously learning, and contributing meaningfully to the profession.</p>
							<p>It’s an ongoing adventure, and I embrace both the challenges and growth that come with it. My progression from student to professional has not been just about acquiring knowledge, it’s been about applying it with purpose, with integrity, and with a dedication to others.</p>
